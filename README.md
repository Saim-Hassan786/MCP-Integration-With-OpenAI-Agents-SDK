# MCP ↔ OpenAI Agents SDK

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that standardizes how external data, tools, and workflows are exposed to LLM-based applications. It separates *who provides context* (MCP **servers**) from *who consumes it* (MCP **clients/hosts*), enabling plug-and-play connections between models and data sources. The OpenAI Agents SDK provides a lightweight framework to build agentic applications (LLMs + tools + workflow). Integrating MCP with Agents lets agents consume a wide, standardized set of tools/data without custom adapters for each resource.


## What is MCP? (conceptual)

* **Purpose:** Provide a standard, bidirectional protocol for exposing context (documents, tools, workflows, search, etc.) to LLMs so apps don’t reinvent connectors for each data source. 
* **Core idea:** Think of MCP like a standard port (the “USB-C of AI”) — with a common wire protocol and semantics so any MCP-compliant server can be queried by any MCP client/host. This standardization allows LLMs or agent frameworks to request structured context (chunks, tool schemas, streaming outputs) in a predictable way.


## What is the OpenAI Agents SDK? (conceptual)

* **Purpose:** Provide primitives for building agentic apps: an agent (LLM + instructions), tools (callable capabilities), and orchestration for multi-turn decision making. The SDK exposes ways to register tools and run agents that may call those tools during reasoning.
* **Why it matters:** Agents SDK saves you from wiring up prompt orchestration and tool-handling logic manually; it provides lifecycle hooks, tool schemas, streaming, and error-handling primitives developers need for production agents.


## Why integrate MCP with Agents?

1. **Standardization:** Agents can call MCP servers as tools without bespoke adapters per data source — one integration provides access to many data sources.
2. **Security & scope control:** MCP servers can explicitly advertise capabilities and scopes; agents request only what’s necessary, making least-privilege easier at protocol level.
3. **Streaming & large-context handling:** MCP supports streamed responses and chunked context, letting agents retrieve and process large datasets efficiently rather than embedding giant prompt windows.
4. **Ecosystem interoperability:** Multiple vendors (clients/servers) can interoperate; Microsoft, Anthropic and others are adopting/supporting MCP patterns, increasing available integrations.


## Architectural patterns & data flow (theory)

Below are common patterns when combining MCP and agent frameworks:

1. **Agent-as-host (client) → MCP servers (tools):**

   * The agent runtime (OpenAI Agents SDK) instantiates an MCP client that connects to one or many MCP servers.
   * During reasoning, the agent calls an MCP tool (e.g., `search_repo`, `list_files`, `execute_workflow`), receives structured context back, and uses it in the next turn.

2. **Pre-fetch / Retrieval Layer:**

   * Precompute relevant chunks via a retrieval system exposed by an MCP server; the agent receives only relevant chunks (ranked, with provenance) to reduce prompt size.

3. **Interactive / streaming tools:**

   * MCP servers may stream back incremental tool outputs (e.g., logs, long search results) that agents can process as they arrive and update decision state incrementally.

4. **Two-way workflows:**

   * Agents can request the server to perform actions (create PR, modify dataset). The server performs the action under its policies and returns a result with provenance and audit data.


## Transports & connection models (theory)

MCP supports multiple transports depending on the server/client implementation:

* **Stdout/stdin (stdio) pipes:** Common for local integrations where a process is launched and communicates over stdio.
* **HTTP streaming / chunked responses:** Useful for remote servers and long-running or streaming responses.
* **WebSocket / specialized streaming transports:** Lower-latency two-way channels for interactive sessions.

When designing integration with an Agents SDK, prefer the transport supported by both the MCP client implementation and your deployment environment (e.g., HTTP streaming for remote hosted MCP servers).


## How MCP concepts map to Agents SDK primitives (theory)

* **MCP Server → Tool Providers:** In Agents SDK terms, an MCP server provides tools (callable endpoints) that can be mapped to the SDK’s tool interface. The SDK calls the tool, receives structured output, and continues reasoning.
* **MCP Client (inside host) → Tool Adapter / Connector:** The Agents SDK will use an MCP client (library) to communicate; this client acts as the adapter layer that translates SDK tool calls into MCP messages and back.
* **MCP schemas → Tool schemas & function signatures:** MCP advertises schemas for tools and responses; these can be used to auto-generate tool descriptors (name, params, return types) that the Agents SDK uses to present function-like tools to the model.
* **Streaming MCP responses → Agent streaming hooks:** When MCP streams partial results, the Agents SDK streaming hooks can forward those partial outputs back to the model or UI for incremental updates.
